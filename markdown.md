# What Are Variables in Shell Scripting and How to Write Them:
## What Are Variables in Shell Scripting?
### Definition: Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold data (e.g., strings, integers) during script execution. You assign a value to a variable, and later reference it by its name to retrieve or modify that value.
## Purpose: 
### They make scripts flexible and reusable by allowing you to:

##### >Store user inputs (e.g., a username from the command line).
##### >Hold intermediate results (e.g., a file path after creation).
##### >Avoid hardcoding values, making scripts adaptable to different environments.
